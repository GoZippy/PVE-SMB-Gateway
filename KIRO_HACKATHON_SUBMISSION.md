# Proxmox SMB Gateway: Revolutionizing Storage Management

## Elevator Pitch

**"Transform Proxmox SMB management from complex NAS VMs to one-click shares in 30 seconds"**

The PVE SMB Gateway is a revolutionary plugin that eliminates the need for resource-heavy NAS VMs in Proxmox environments. Instead of spending 5+ minutes creating and managing 2GB+ RAM NAS VMs, administrators can now create lightweight SMB shares using 80MB LXC containers in under 30 seconds through a simple web wizard.

Our solution provides enterprise-grade features like Active Directory integration, high availability with CTDB clustering, and comprehensive monitoring - all while reducing resource usage by 96% and deployment time by 10x. Perfect for homelabs, small businesses, and enterprise environments that need efficient, scalable SMB storage without the overhead of traditional NAS VMs.

## Project Story

### Inspiration

The inspiration for the PVE SMB Gateway came from a frustrating experience managing SMB shares in a Proxmox environment. As a system administrator, I was tired of creating resource-heavy NAS VMs that consumed 2GB+ of RAM just to serve simple file shares. The traditional approach felt like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame - overkill for what should be a simple task.

I realized that Proxmox administrators everywhere were facing the same inefficiency: they needed SMB shares but were forced to create full VMs with all the overhead that entailed. There had to be a better way to leverage Proxmox's container technology to create lightweight, efficient SMB gateways that integrated seamlessly with the existing storage infrastructure.

The vision was clear: **make SMB share creation as simple as creating a VM or container in Proxmox, but with 96% less resource usage and 10x faster deployment**.

### What it does

The PVE SMB Gateway transforms how administrators manage SMB/CIFS shares in Proxmox environments. Instead of creating resource-heavy NAS VMs, users can now create lightweight SMB shares through a simple web wizard that integrates directly into the Proxmox interface.

**Core Features:**
- **Three Deployment Modes**: LXC containers (80MB RAM), native host installation, or dedicated VMs
- **One-Click Creation**: Complete share setup in under 30 seconds through an ExtJS wizard
- **Enterprise Integration**: Active Directory domain joining, Kerberos authentication, and CTDB high availability
- **Resource Efficiency**: 96% less memory usage compared to traditional NAS VMs
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time I/O statistics, connection tracking, and quota management
- **CLI Automation**: Full command-line interface for scripting and automation

**Real-World Impact:**
- **Homelab Users**: Save 2GB RAM per share, deploy in 30 seconds
- **Small Businesses**: Eliminate NAS VM management overhead with AD integration
- **Enterprise**: HA-ready with CTDB clustering and comprehensive monitoring
- **MSPs**: Scalable solution for multiple client environments
