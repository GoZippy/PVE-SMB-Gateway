# Implementation Plan - Phase 1 Completion

## Task Overview

This implementation plan converts the Phase 1 completion design into actionable development tasks. Each task builds incrementally toward a stable v1.0.0 release with all core features implemented.

**Current Status**: v0.1.0 has basic LXC and Native modes working. VM mode, CTDB HA, monitoring, backup integration, and security hardening need implementation.

## Completed Features (v0.1.0)

- [x] **Basic Storage Plugin**: Core PVE::Storage::Plugin implementation with type, properties, and lifecycle methods
- [x] **LXC Mode**: Complete LXC container provisioning with Samba installation and configuration
- [x] **Native Mode**: Host-based Samba installation with share configuration
- [x] **ExtJS Wizard**: Web interface with form validation and mode selection (VM mode shows "Coming Soon")
- [x] **CLI Tool**: Basic command-line interface with list, create, delete, and status commands
- [x] **Error Handling**: Basic rollback system for failed provisioning
- [x] **Configuration Support**: Quota, AD domain, and CTDB VIP configuration fields (UI only, backend incomplete)
- [x] **Build System**: Debian packaging with dpkg-buildpackage
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Basic module loading and share creation tests
- [x] **Documentation**: README, architecture docs, and build instructions

## Current Implementation Status Analysis

Based on code review, the following features are **actually implemented**:
- ‚úÖ **LXC Mode**: Fully functional with container creation, Samba installation, and bind mounts
- ‚úÖ **Native Mode**: Functional with host-based Samba configuration and share creation
- ‚úÖ **Basic CLI**: Working list, create, delete, status commands with API integration
- ‚úÖ **ExtJS UI**: Complete wizard with form validation and all configuration fields
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Basic rollback system with @rollback_steps array tracking
- ‚úÖ **Storage Plugin**: Full PVE storage plugin implementation with lifecycle methods
- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests**: Basic module loading and share creation tests implemented

The following features are **partially implemented** (UI fields exist but backend logic is incomplete):
- üîÑ **AD Domain Integration**: UI field exists, basic config written with realm and security settings, but no actual domain joining
- üîÑ **CTDB VIP**: UI field exists, parameter passed through, but no CTDB setup
- üîÑ **Quota Management**: UI field exists, basic setquota call implemented, but needs enhancement

The following features are **not implemented** (marked as "not implemented yet" in code):
- ‚ùå **VM Mode**: UI shows "VM (Coming Soon)", backend throws "not implemented yet" errors
- ‚ùå **Performance Monitoring**: No monitoring code exists
- ‚ùå **Backup Integration**: No backup-related code exists
- ‚ùå **Security Hardening**: Basic security but no advanced hardening
- ‚ùå **Enhanced CLI**: Basic functionality only, no JSON output or advanced features
