# Requirements Document - Phase 1 Completion

## Introduction

This specification covers the completion of Phase 1 of the PVE SMB Gateway Plugin, focusing on stabilizing existing features, implementing missing core functionality, and preparing for Phase 2 development. The current v0.1.0 release has basic LXC and Native modes working, but several critical features need completion before Phase 2.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: VM Mode Implementation

**User Story:** As a Proxmox administrator, I want to deploy SMB shares using dedicated VMs so that I can have complete isolation and custom configurations for high-security environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "VM" mode in the ExtJS wizard THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated VM with Samba pre-configured
2. WHEN VM mode is selected THEN the system SHALL use a pre-built VM template with minimal Debian/Ubuntu and Samba
3. WHEN the VM is created THEN the system SHALL attach the specified storage path as a virtio-fs mount or RBD device
4. WHEN VM provisioning fails THEN the system SHALL clean up partial VM creation and provide clear error messages
5. IF no suitable VM template exists THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for template creation

### Requirement 2: Enhanced High Availability with CTDB

**User Story:** As an enterprise administrator, I want SMB shares to automatically failover between nodes so that clients experience minimal downtime during maintenance or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CTDB VIP is configured THEN the system SHALL set up CTDB clustering between nodes
2. WHEN a node fails THEN the SMB service SHALL migrate to another node within 30 seconds
3. WHEN failover occurs THEN clients SHALL reconnect automatically using the VIP address
4. WHEN CTDB is enabled THEN the system SHALL validate cluster connectivity before share creation
5. IF CTDB setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed troubleshooting information

### Requirement 3: Advanced Active Directory Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want seamless Active Directory integration so that users can access SMB shares with their domain credentials without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AD domain is specified THEN the system SHALL automatically join the domain using provided credentials
2. WHEN AD join succeeds THEN the system SHALL configure Kerberos authentication for the share
3. WHEN AD users access shares THEN they SHALL authenticate using their domain credentials
4. WHEN AD join fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and remediation steps
5. IF domain controller is unreachable THEN the system SHALL fall back to local authentication with warnings

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Error Handling and Rollback

**User Story:** As a Proxmox administrator, I want failed share creation to automatically clean up partial configurations so that my system remains in a consistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any provisioning step fails THEN the system SHALL execute rollback procedures in reverse order
2. WHEN rollback occurs THEN the system SHALL remove created containers, VMs, and configuration files
3. WHEN rollback completes THEN the system SHALL log all cleanup actions for audit purposes
4. WHEN multiple shares exist THEN rollback SHALL only affect the failed share creation
5. IF rollback itself fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and provide manual cleanup instructions

### Requirement 5: Performance Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor SMB share performance and usage so that I can optimize resource allocation and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shares are active THEN the system SHALL expose I/O metrics via Proxmox API
2. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track throughput, IOPS, and connection counts
3. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log warnings
4. WHEN requested via API THEN the system SHALL provide real-time and historical metrics
5. IF monitoring fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating without metrics collection

### Requirement 6: Backup Integration

**User Story:** As a backup administrator, I want SMB shares to integrate with Proxmox backup schedules so that share data is protected consistently with other VM/CT backups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup is scheduled THEN the system SHALL create consistent snapshots of share data
2. WHEN using LXC mode THEN backups SHALL include both container and bind-mounted data
3. WHEN using VM mode THEN backups SHALL include VM disk and attached storage
4. WHEN backup fails THEN the system SHALL retry according to configured policies
5. IF snapshot creation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt backup without snapshot and log warnings

### Requirement 7: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want SMB shares to follow security best practices so that they don't introduce vulnerabilities to my Proxmox environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shares are created THEN the system SHALL enforce SMB2+ protocol minimum
2. WHEN AD integration is used THEN the system SHALL enable SMB signing by default
3. WHEN native mode is used THEN the system SHALL create dedicated service users with minimal privileges
4. WHEN containers are created THEN they SHALL run with security profiles and resource limits
5. IF security configurations fail THEN the system SHALL refuse to create insecure shares

### Requirement 8: Enhanced CLI Management

**User Story:** As an automation engineer, I want comprehensive CLI tools so that I can manage SMB shares programmatically and integrate with configuration management systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using CLI THEN all GUI functions SHALL be available via command line
2. WHEN CLI commands execute THEN they SHALL provide structured output (JSON) for scripting
3. WHEN CLI operations fail THEN they SHALL return appropriate exit codes and error messages
4. WHEN batch operations are performed THEN the CLI SHALL support parallel execution
5. IF API is unavailable THEN the CLI SHALL provide clear connectivity error messages
