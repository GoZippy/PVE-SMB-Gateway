## 5. Representations

You represent that:
- You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
- If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions to the Project, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project.
- Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation.
- You are not aware of any third-party licenses or other restrictions (such as related patents and trademarks) that would prevent Us from using Your Contributions as described in this Agreement.

## 6. Support
